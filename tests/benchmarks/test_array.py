    n-step map-reduce:

    1. map: create huge amounts of random data (5x the available memory on the whole
       cluster).
       The chunking is either by single column ("thin") or square; chunk size is 100MiB
       per chunk in both cases.
       Tasks in this group terminate almost instantly.

    2. map: in the "slow" use case, sleep for 0.5s after generating each 100MiB chunk.
       This step simulates e.g. a quite fast read from storage or midly intensive
       in-place computation. This step is skipped in the "fast" use case.

    3. map: first stage of dask.array.Array.sum(axis=1). Reduce each chunk individually
       along the columns. In case of "thin" chunks, this is a no-op.
       In case of "square" chunks, chunk sizes are negligible after this step.

    4. reduce: sum groups of <split_every> (default 4) contiguous chunks, thus
       obtaining 1/4th of the original chunks.

       In the "thin" chunk configuration, this step heavily relies on co-assignment -
       that is, it relies on the 4 nearby chunks to have been generated (most times) on
       the same worker and not need to be transferred across the network. Without
       co-assignment, this will result in up to the whole map output to be transferred
       across the network.

    5. reduce: recursively repeat step 4 until only one chunk remains.

    See dask/array/reductions.py for the implementation of recursive reductions.
