# Coiled Runtime

[![Tests](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-runtime/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-runtime/actions/workflows/tests.yml) [![Linting](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-runtime/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-runtime/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

The Coiled Runtime is a conda metapackage which makes it easy to get started with Dask.

## Install

`coiled-runtime` can be installed with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge coiled-runtime
```

**Nightly builds**
  
`coiled-runtime` has nightly conda packages for testing purposes.
You can install a nightly version of `coiled-runtime` with:

```bash
conda install -c coiled/label/dev -c dask/label/dev coiled-runtime 
```

## Build

To build and install `coiled-runtime` locally, use the following steps:

```bash
# Have a local copy of the `coiled-runtime` repository
git clone https://github.com/coiled/coiled-runtime
cd coiled-runtime

# Make sure conda-build is installed
conda install -c conda-forge conda-build

# Build the metapackage
conda build recipe -c conda-forge --output-folder dist/conda --no-anaconda-upload

# Install the built `coiled-runtime` metapackage
conda install -c ./dist/conda/ -c conda-forge coiled-runtime
```

## Test

The `coiled-runtime` test suite can be run locally with the following steps:

1. Ensure your local machine is authenticated to use the `dask-engineering` Coiled account and
   the Coiled Dask Engineering AWS S3 account.
2. Create a Python environment and install development dependencies as
   specified in `ci/environment.yml`.
3. (Optional) If testing against an unreleased version of `coiled-runtime`,
   create a Coiled software with the unreleased `coiled-runtime` installed
   and set a local `COILED_SOFTWARE_NAME` environment variable to the name
   of the software environment (e.g. `export COILED_SOFTWARE_NAME="account/software-name"`)
4. Run tests with `python -m pytest tests`

Additionally, tests are automatically run on pull requests to this repository.
See the section below on creating pull requests.

## Contribute

This repository uses GitHub Actions secrets for managing authentication tokens used
to access resources like Coiled clusters, S3 buckets, etc. However, because GitHub Actions [doesn't
grant access to secrets for forked repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow),
**please submit pull requests directly from the `coiled/coiled-runtime` repository,
not a personal fork**.

## Release

To issue a new `coiled-runtime` release:

1. Locally update the `coiled-runtime` version and package pinnings specified in `recipe/meta.yaml`.
    - When updating package version pinnings (in particular `dask` and `distributed`)
      confirm there are no reported large scale stability issues (e.g. deadlocks) or
      performance regressions on the `dask` / `distributed` issue trackers or offline
      reports.
2. Open a pull request to the `coiled-runtime` repository titled "Release X.Y.Z" with these changes
   (where `X.Y.Z` is replaced with the actual version for the release).
3. After all CI builds have passed the release pull request can be merged.
4. Add a new git tag for the release by following the steps below on your local machine:

```bash
# Pull in changes from the Release X.Y.Z PR
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Set release version number
export RELEASE=X.Y.Z
# Create and push release tag
git tag -a $RELEASE -m "Version $RELEASE"
git push origin main --tags
```

5. Update the `coiled-runtime` package on conda-forge by opening a pull request to the
   [`coiled-runtime` conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/coiled-runtime-feedstock)
   which updates the `coiled-runtime` version and package version pinnings.
    - Note that pull requests to conda-forge feedstocks must come from a fork.
    - Reset the build number back to `0` if it isn't already.
    - For more information on updating conda-forge packages, see the
      [conda-forge docs](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/updating_pkgs.html).
