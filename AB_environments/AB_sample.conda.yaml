# Sample conda environment file for A/B testing.
# Change contents/delete/rename as needed.

# Every A/B environment *must* present these three files:
# - AB_<name>.conda.yaml
# - AB_<name>.dask.yaml
# - AB_<name>.cluster.yaml

# You should always start from a copy-paste from AB_baseline.conda.yaml
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
    - python =3.9  # Single '=' means latest patch version available
    # Copy-paste from AB_baseline.conda.yaml
