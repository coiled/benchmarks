# Static kwargs passed to coiled.Cluster
# In A/B tests, these can be overridden by AB_environments/AB_<name>.cluster.yaml

# The override priority is as follows (bottom wins):
# 1. default parameters of coiled.Cluster
# 2. default section of this file
# 3. default section of AB_environments/AB_<name>.cluster.yaml
# 4. specific sections of this file
# 5. specific sections of AB_environments/AB_<name>.cluster.yaml

# The keys 'name', 'environ', and 'tags' must not be used.
